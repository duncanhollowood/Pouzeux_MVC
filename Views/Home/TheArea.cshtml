        <h3>     Things to do in the local area <br> </h3>

        Meet the locals at bar Genest Gueriaud Dominique Jeanne in Cressanges.
        Wine tasting. We can recommend Famille Laurent in Saulcet (20 minute drive) but there are many more, particularly around Saulcet.
        Brocantes (flea market). Once a month on Saturdays and Sundays in Cressanges.
        Maison Mantin, a restored 19th-century house in the centre of Moulins that does excellent guided tours. For more museums in the local area visit http://musees.allier.fr.
        Souvigny (15 minute drive) is a pretty town with a priory. Each year from late July to early August it hosts an impressive medieval festival.
        Saint-Pourçain (20 minute drive) has a market on Saturdays and a wine museum. There is a tourist information office and free parking as you come into the town (opposite the market square).
        Moulins (25 minute drive) has canoeing on the River Allier, a cathedral plus lots of shopping, bars and restaurants. Le Grand Café is worth a visit just for the décor.
