        <h2>Things to do<br></h2>
        - Meet the locals at bar Genest Gueriaud Dominique Jeanne in Cressanges.
        - Wine tasting. We can recommend Famille Laurent in Saulcet (20 minute drive) but there are many more, particularly around Saulcet.
        Brocantes (flea market). Once a month on Saturdays and Sundays in Cressanges.
        - Maison Mantin, a restored 19th-century house in the centre of Moulins that does excellent guided tours. For more museums in the local area visit http://musees.allier.fr.
        - Souvigny (15 minute drive) is a pretty town with a priory. Each year from late July to early August it hosts an impressive medieval festival.
        - Saint-Pourçain (20 minute drive) has a market on Saturdays and a wine museum. There is a tourist information office and free parking as you come into the town (opposite the market square).
        - Moulins (25 minute drive) has canoeing on the River Allier, a cathedral plus lots of shopping, bars and restaurants. Le Grand Café is worth a visit just for the décor.
